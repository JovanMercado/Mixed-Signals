# Mixed Signals

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN CANCELLED. SIGNAL DOES NOT WANT FORKS TO USE NEITHER THE NAME "SIGNAL" NOR OPEN WHISPER'S SERVERS.

Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.
This Project aims to bring extra cosmetic features to Signal Private Messenger while keeping the Core of the app intact.

Signal uses your phone's data connection (WiFi/3G/4G) to communicate securely, optionally supports plain SMS/MMS to function as a unified messenger, and can also encrypt the stored messages on your phone.

This Project is not available for download at the Moment

## Contributing Bug reports
Since this is a Cosmetic only fork, for any bugs related to the Core functionality of the app, please report the bug to the original project first since we pull from there.

Please search the existing issues for your bug and create a new one if the issue is not yet tracked!
